# Ground-Water-Level-Predictor
Groundwater plays a critical role in sustaining agricultural, industrial, and domestic water needs, particularly in regions facing water scarcity. As groundwater depletion becomes a pressing global issue, the need for predictive models to forecast groundwater levels and support sustainable resource management is paramount. This study presents Water Benders, a machine learning-based model for predicting groundwater levels, which analyses historical groundwater data along with environmental and geographical factors to generate accurate future water level forecasts. The proposed model utilizes a well-structured data pipeline that involves data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy. Key input variables include geographic coordinates, well site type, and past water levels. By training on these parameters, the model identifies underlying trends and patterns in groundwater fluctuations. The model is deployed using FastAPI, making it accessible through a web interface where users can input location data and obtain predictions of future groundwater levels. Additionally, the interface incorporates an interactive map to visualize the geographic context of the predictions. The system offers practical applications for policymakers, farmers, and water resource managers by providing timely insights into groundwater trends. These predictions assist in making informed decisions related to water extraction, irrigation planning, and resource conservation. The research underscores the importance of integrating machine learning techniques in environmental monitoring and provides a scalable solution for predicting groundwater levels in various regions. The results of this study highlight the modelâ€™s potential to contribute to more effective and sustainable groundwater management strategies.
